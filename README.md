# my-portfolio
Creating a portfolio for potential employers to view so that they may assess my skills as a developer.

## The About Section
In my own words I wrote a short description of myself. This gives the employer a look into the person behind the keyboard.

## The My Work Section
This section will house links for projects to come.

## The Contact Me Section
This area gives the employer all necessary contact info including email, phone number, and github account.

## The Resume Section
A link to my official resume will be provided here so all skills and experience can be assessed and evaluated by the employer.
